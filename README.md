# Optimizing Arsenal's Formation: A Comparative Analysis with EPL's Big 6 Teams

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Arsenal Football Club's formation strategies and compares them with the "Big 6" teams of the English Premier League (EPL): Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Tottenham Hotspur. Using advanced machine learning techniques and statistical analysis, the study aims to provide data-driven insights to enhance Arsenal's tactical decisions and overall performance in the EPL.

## Introduction

The primary goal of this project is to evaluate and optimize Arsenal's formation strategy by comparing it with other top EPL teams. This is achieved using data-driven methods, including machine learning and predictive modeling, to assess different formations and player combinations to suggest optimal strategies.

## Dataset Collection

The datasets were sourced from [FBref](https://fbref.com/), a reliable platform for football statistics. It includes data from Arsenal and the "Big 6" EPL teams for the 2023-2024 season, covering player statistics, team performance indicators, formations, and tactical data. Data preprocessing and cleaning were performed to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the data. Various visualizations, including histograms, density plots, and scatter plots, were used to understand player performance, team dynamics, and strategic decisions.

## Model Building

Three machine learning models were employed to predict Arsenal's optimal formation based on historical match data:

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The SVM model was used with various kernels (RBF, polynomial, and sigmoid) and hyperparameters tuned using `GridSearchCV`. The model aimed to find the optimal decision boundary that separates different classes to predict match outcomes.

### Random Forest Model

The Random Forest model, an ensemble learning technique, was used to build multiple decision trees and average their predictions to reduce overfitting and improve predictive accuracy.

### Gradient Boosting Model

The Gradient Boosting Model builds an ensemble of weaker learners, gradually enhancing prediction accuracy by correcting errors made by previous models. It is robust in handling complex, non-linear patterns in the data.

## Results

- **SVM Model**: Achieved a test accuracy of 50% with optimized hyperparameters. Precision, recall, and F1-score were suboptimal, indicating limitations in capturing complex data patterns.
- **Random Forest Model**: Showed an accuracy of 31.67% with low precision (17.78%) and F1-score (21.78%), suggesting overfitting or inadequate feature representation.
- **Gradient Boosting Model**: Achieved an accuracy of 30%, with low precision (20.83%) and F1-score (23.89%), demonstrating inadequate performance on the given dataset.

The Random Forest model predicted that the "4-3-3" formation is Arsenal's most frequently used and potentially optimal formation.

## Conclusion and Future Work

While the models provided some insights into formation trends, their overall predictive performance was limited. Future work should focus on enhancing data quality, feature engineering, and exploring more advanced machine learning models, such as deep learning or hybrid models, to better capture complex patterns.
